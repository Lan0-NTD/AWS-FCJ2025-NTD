Over the 12 weeks participating in the First Cloud Journey program at Amazon Web Services (AWS) Vietnam as an FCJ Cloud Intern, I had the opportunity to experience a complete, structured “cloud onboarding” journey similar to a full-time employee: from learning AWS fundamentals and building the infrastructure foundation, to practicing application modernization and applying generative AI to real-world use cases. The program began with weeks focused on getting familiar with the working environment, regulations, team culture, and internal training systems; in parallel, I was guided to create and configure an AWS Free Tier account, install and use the AWS CLI, get used to the AWS Management Console, and explore core service groups such as Compute, Storage, Networking, and Database. Through basic hands-on labs with Amazon EC2 (creating instances, SSH access, managing EBS, Elastic IP), I built a solid foundation in how AWS organizes resources, handles access control, and operates infrastructure on the cloud.

On that foundation, the following weeks sequentially focused on designing standardized infrastructure architecture (VPC, subnets, routes, security groups, private connectivity), managing cost and security following the AWS Well-Architected guidelines; then gradually transitioned to application modernization with serverless architecture (AWS Lambda, Amazon API Gateway, Amazon DynamoDB, S3, Cognito) and experimenting with AI/ML services—especially Amazon Bedrock with models like Claude for use cases such as internal assistants, RAG, and business support scenarios. In parallel with the technical work, I maintained a detailed weekly Worklog, wrote proposals, translated and summarized various AWS technical blogs, and participated in workshops and events such as the AWS Cloud Mastery Series. These activities helped me improve my ability to read and understand English documentation, systematize knowledge, and present technical content to others.

In terms of soft skills and workplace experience, I worked in a very friendly and open environment, receiving close support from mentors and the admin team; the working style, which emphasizes “trying things yourself and solving problems independently,” helped me mature in both technical thinking and professional attitude. The assigned tasks were closely aligned with my specialization in Artificial Intelligence and Cloud Computing, while also expanding into practical skills such as using task management tools, teamwork, communication in a corporate environment, and technical writing. After 12 weeks, I not only strengthened my understanding of AWS core services and how to design and operate systems on the cloud, but also gained a clearer view of workflows, culture, and expectations inside a global technology organization like AWS Vietnam, forming a solid foundation for my future career in the Cloud & AI domain.
