# **Vietnam Cloud Day 2025**
# **Ho Chi Minh City Connect Edition for Builders – GenAI and Data Track**

**Location**: AWS Event Hall, L26 Bitexco Tower, HCMC

**Time**: 1PM Thursday, September 18, 2025

## **Event Objectives**

* Provide an overview of the **Agentic AI** trend and AWS’s vision.  
* Explore strategies for building a unified data foundation for AI & Analytics on AWS.  
* Analyze the GenAI roadmap, AI Agent architectures, and challenges when moving to production.  
* Learn about the **AI-Driven Development Lifecycle (AI-DLC)** model.  
* Understand security principles, risk governance, and Responsible AI in Generative AI.  
* Introduce new AWS services that support AI Agents and enhance enterprise productivity.

## **Speaker List**

* **Jun Kai Loke** – AI/ML Specialist Solutions Architect, AWS  
* **Kien Nguyen** – Solutions Architect, AWS  
* **Tamelly Lim** – Storage Specialist Solutions Architect, AWS  
* **Binh Tran** – Senior Solutions Architect, AWS  
* **Taiki Dang** – Solutions Architect, AWS  
* **Christal Poon** – Specialist Solutions Architect, AWS

## **Key Highlights**

### **Opening – Agentic AI Overview – Jun Kai Loke**

#### **Agentic AI and development trends**

* Agentic AI is a leading strategic trend, aiming toward self-operating systems, reduced human supervision, and deep automation.  
* Successful examples: Katalon, Apero, Techcom Securities.

#### **Amazon Bedrock – The AI development platform**

* Secure deployment at scale  
* Integration of tools and memory  
* End-to-end monitoring

### **Building a Unified Data Foundation on AWS – Kien Nguyen**

#### **Current challenges**

* 89% of CDOs are deploying GenAI, but only 52% consider their data platform ready (Harvard Business Review).  
* Causes: data silos, people silos, business silos.

#### **End-to-End data strategy:** 

Three main components:

* **Producers**  
* **Foundations**  
* **Consumers**

#### **Key AWS data components**

* **Amazon Bedrock**  
* **Databases** – RDS, specialized databases supporting vector search  
* **Analytics & ML** – SageMaker, Unified Studio  
* **Data & AI Governance**  
* **Lake House Architecture** – S3, Redshift Managed Storage, Iceberg Open API  
* **Amazon DataZone**

### **GenAI Roadmap & AI Agents Architecture – Jun Kai Loke & Tamelly Lim**

Blueprint for building AI Agents: Model & application capabilities, tool framework.

Amazon Bedrock

Amazon Nova – new developments and customization

Strands Agents – next-generation Agent models

Challenges when bringing Agents to production

→ AWS introduces Amazon Bedrock AgentCore to address these issues.

#### **AgentCore components**

* Agent Core Runtime  
* Agent Core Gateway  
* Memory  
* Agent Browser  
* Code Interpreter  

→ Enhances security and scalability.

### **AI-Driven Development Lifecycle (AI-DLC) – Binh Tran**

#### **Two current software development patterns**

* **AI Managed Pattern** – low supervision but lower reliability  
* **AI Assisted Pattern** – AI assists small tasks but still limited

#### **AI-DLC – The new software development lifecycle**

Includes 3 phases:

#### **1. Inception**

* Build context  
* Draft user stories  
* Plan with work units

#### **2. Construction**

* Code + test  
* Add architecture components  
* Deploy IaC + testing

#### **3. Operation**

* Production deployment using IaC  
* Incident management

### **Securing Generative AI Applications – Taiki Dang**

#### **Key security factors**

* Compliance & Governance  
* Legal & Privacy  
* Controls  
* Risk Management  
* Resilience

#### **Scoping matrix**

* Consumer App  
* Enterprise App  
* Pre-trained models  
* Fine-tuned models  
* Self-trained models

#### **Frameworks & Standards**

* AWS Well-Architected  
* MITRE ATLAS  
* OWASP Top 10 for LLM Apps  
* NIST AI 600-1  
* ISO 42001  
* EU AI Act

#### **Risks across layers**

* Consumer: IP, Legal, Hallucination, Safety  
* Tuner: managed/hosted, data retention  
* Provider: training data, model construction

#### **Risk mitigation approaches**

* Prompt engineering  
* Fine-tuning  
* RAG  
* Parameter tuning  
* Bedrock Guardrails  
* Prompt security

### **Beyond Automation: AI Agents as Productivity Multipliers – Christal Poon**

#### **Types of AI Agent services**

* Specialized Agents  
* Fully-managed Agents  
* DIY Agents

#### **Enterprise productivity services**

**Amazon QuickSight**

**Amazon Q**:

* Dashboards  
* Reports  
* Executive summaries  
* AI Agent Scenarios

#### **Coming soon in Vietnam**

**QuickSuite**:
* Quick Researcher  
* Quick Automate  
* Humans in the Loop

## **Key Learnings**

* Understanding the Agentic AI ecosystem & AWS Roadmap: Agentic AI is the next generation of automation, oriented toward self-directed systems.  
* Strong data architecture is the foundation of GenAI: S3, Iceberg, Redshift, Bedrock, SageMaker play central roles.  
* AI-DLC enables a modern software development approach: Automation from planning → coding → testing → deployment.  
* Security spans every layer of the AI stack: Requires compliance, data protection, and risk assessment.  
* AWS is expanding the AI Agents & Enterprise AI ecosystem significantly.

## **Applications to Work**

* Integrating AI Agents into business workflows.  
* Using Amazon Bedrock, Amazon Q, and Guardrails for quality and safety.  
* Building a unified data foundation before GenAI.  
* Applying the AI-DLC model to internal development.  
* Building dashboards and insights with QuickSight & Amazon Q.

## **Event Experience**

The workshop provided a clear view of the shift from traditional automation to **Agentic AI**.  
Speakers delivered in-depth, practical content with clear direction for Vietnam’s GenAI adoption.  
The combination of **AgentCore**, **Bedrock**, **AI-DLC**, and **Amazon Q** illustrates a comprehensive picture of enterprise AI.
