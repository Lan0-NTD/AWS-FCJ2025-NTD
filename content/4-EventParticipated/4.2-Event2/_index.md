# **Reimagining Software Engineering**

**Location**: AWS Event Hall, L26 Bitexco Tower, HCMC  
**Time**: 2PM – 4:30PM Friday, October 03, 2025

## **Event Objectives**

* Explore the transformation of the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) in the GenAI era.

* Introduce the AI-Driven Development Lifecycle (AI-DLC) model and how to apply it in real-world projects.

* Demonstrate Amazon Q Developer and KIRO – the AI IDE that supports development from prototype to production.

* Share best practices for developers and businesses to maintain quality control when applying AI across the entire software development process.

## **Speaker List**

* **Toan Huynh** – Senior Specialist Solutions Architect, AWS

* **My Nguyen** – Senior Prototyping Architect, AWS

## **Key Highlights**

### **1\. AI-Driven Development Life Cycle & Amazon Q Developer – Toan Huynh**

#### **The evolution of AI and its impact on SDLC**

* Evolution of AI: **auto-complete → assistant → agents**.

* Each stage reshapes how developers learn, write code, test, deploy, and operate software.

* Even with deep AI assistance, **developers must remain the owners** of the product: making decisions, approving quality, and taking professional responsibility.

#### **Two approaches developers use when working with AI**

* **AI-assisted:** AI is used for narrow tasks → still limited, not enough to cover the whole lifecycle.

* **AI-managed:** AI participates across the entire process, coordinating multiple agents with different roles → the future model.

#### **7 problems when using AI → the birth of AI-DLC**

* AI-DLC lies **between AI-Assisted and AI-Managed**.

* In AI-DLC, AI supports more tasks:

  * Planning

  * Architecture suggestions

  * Clarifying requirements

  * Generating scaffolding

  * Refactoring

  * Testing flows

**However:** developers must still ensure:

* Expertise

* Decisions

* Judgment

* Validation

#### **Core Concepts of AI-DLC**

1. **Mob development:**

   * Mob Elaboration

   * Mob Construction

2. **Spec-driven development:** effective but difficult to customize for complex problems.

3. **Each stage must be clear** about context – input – output.

4. When working with AI, always request **process logs** (not just final output).

5. Provide clear instructions to AI:

   * State exactly what you need

   * Provide relevant documents

   * Avoid prompts like “don’t do ABC”

6. AI works best on tasks requiring precision and structured logic → leverage it for those areas.

#### **Key notes from the speaker**

* Always ask AI to create a **plan**, then review–refine–repeat continuously.

* Break down tasks before assigning them to AI.

* Create **separate sessions** for each task to avoid context interference.

### **2\. KIRO – AI IDE for Prototype to Production – My Nguyen**

#### **Introduction to KIRO**

* An AI IDE designed for the **spec → prototype → production** workflow.

* Supports spec-driven development **directly inside the IDE**.

* Intuitive UI, easy to visualize the entire project workflow.

#### **Key features**

* Agent hooks

* Advanced context management

* Workflow tracking

* Optimized for smaller projects (less documentation than traditional AI-DLC)

#### **Integrating AI-DLC into KIRO**

* AI-DLC methodology can be applied by:

  * Creating a *steering* folder

  * Adding AI-DLC workflows (markdown files) or company *rules*

* Compatible with VSCode, Claude models, and various modern technologies.

#### **Common ground between the two approaches**

Both AI-DLC and KIRO are **based on domain-driven design (DDD)** to ensure clarity of boundaries, context, and business logic.

## **Key Learnings**

#### **AI-driven design mindset**

* AI can automate most SDLC tasks, but humans remain the ultimate decision-makers.

* A clear workflow is required: context → inputs → outputs → validation.

#### **Technical workflow**

* AI-DLC helps automate from planning to testing.

* Mob development \+ spec-driven approaches enhance transparency and quality control.

* Always store AI reasoning logs for verification.

#### **Effective ways to work with AI**

* Ask AI to generate a detailed plan first.

* Break down problems.

* Avoid overloading a single session.

* Leverage AI’s strengths in structured and consistency-required tasks.

#### **Tools**

* Amazon Q Developer supports end-to-end SDLC automation.

* KIRO is suitable for smaller products and fast prototype-to-production needs.

## **Applications to Work**

* Apply AI-DLC to the current workflow to reduce planning, design, and review time.

* Use Amazon Q Developer to accelerate coding, architecture, and testing.

* Use KIRO for projects requiring rapid prototyping or high visual clarity.

* Establish clear workflows \+ record reasoning to ensure quality control when AI has deep involvement in SDLC.

## **Event Experience**

The session provided a clear perspective on how GenAI is reshaping software engineering.  
The speakers offered practical methodologies, modern tools, and applicable approaches for projects of any scale.  
The combination of Amazon Q Developer and KIRO delivers a complete picture of AI-driven development – from enterprise workflows to prototype builds.
