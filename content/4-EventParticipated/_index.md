### [Event 1](4.1-Event1/)

 **Event Name:** Vietnam Cloud Day 2025

 **Date & Time:** 13:00, Thursday, 18 September 2025

 **Location:** 26th Floor, Bitexco Tower, 02 Hai Trieu Street, Saigon Ward, Ho Chi Minh City

 **Role:** Attendee

**Event Summary:** The Vietnam Cloud Day 2025 event (GenAI and Data Track) focused on the Agentic AI ecosystem and data platforms for GenAI on AWS. Speakers presented AWS’s Agentic AI vision with Amazon Bedrock, Amazon Nova, Strands Agents, and Bedrock AgentCore, while emphasizing the importance of a unified data foundation (S3, Lake House, Redshift, Iceberg, SageMaker, DataZone) to support analytics and AI at scale. The content also covered the GenAI roadmap & AI-DLC (AI-Driven Development Lifecycle) with three phases: Inception – Construction – Operation; security and Responsible AI principles (Well-Architected, MITRE ATLAS, OWASP LLM, NIST, ISO, EU AI Act); along with productivity tools such as Amazon Q, QuickSight, and specialized AI Agents. Through the event, I gained a clearer understanding of how AWS shapes Agentic AI architectures from data and models to applications; the crucial role of a data foundation before deploying GenAI; the importance of security, risk governance, and compliance; as well as how to apply AI-DLC and services like Bedrock, Amazon Q, Guardrails, and QuickSight to build GenAI systems and AI Agents for enterprises.

### [Event 2](4.2-Event2/)

 **Event Name:** AI-Driven Development Life Cycle: Reimagining Software Engineering

 **Date & Time:** 14:00 – 16:30, 03/10/2025

 **Location:** 26th Floor, Bitexco Tower, 02 Hai Trieu Street, Saigon Ward, Ho Chi Minh City

 **Role:** Attendee

**Event Summary:** The “Reimagining Software Engineering” event focused on rethinking the entire software development life cycle in the GenAI era through the AI-Driven Development Lifecycle (AI-DLC) model and tools such as Amazon Q Developer and KIRO – AI IDE. Toan Huynh’s talk clarified the evolution from auto-complete → assistant → agents, distinguished between the AI-assisted and AI-managed approaches, and introduced AI-DLC as a “balance point” where AI deeply supports planning, architecture, requirements clarification, scaffolding, refactoring, and testing, while developers still retain ownership of expertise, decision-making, and verification. Concepts such as mob development, spec-driven development, clearly defining context–input–output, requiring AI to record its reasoning, always starting by asking AI to create a plan, breaking tasks down, and separating sessions were emphasized as best practices when working with GenAI. My Nguyen’s part introduced KIRO as an AI IDE designed for the spec → prototype → production flow, supporting spec-driven development directly in the IDE, managing context, tracking workflows and integrating AI-DLC (via steering folders, workflow .md, internal rules), while remaining compatible with VSCode and Claude models. From this event, I learned to look at SDLC from an AI-driven perspective: AI can automate a large portion of activities, but humans must design the process, control quality, and bear ultimate responsibility; the effective way to leverage AI is to clearly define context, input/output requirements, capture reasoning, and use AI where structure is strongest (specs, test flows, refactoring), while choosing the right tools: Amazon Q Developer for end-to-end SDLC automation and KIRO for projects that require a fast, visual prototype-to-production flow.

### [Event 3](4.3-Event3/)

 **Event Name:** AI/ML/GenAI on AWS

 **Date & Time:** 8:30 – 12:00, 15/11/2025

 **Location:** 26th Floor, Bitexco Tower, 02 Hai Trieu Street, Saigon Ward, Ho Chi Minh City

 **Role:** Attendee

**Event Summary:** The event focused on the overall landscape of AI/ML and Generative AI on AWS, introducing service layers from AI Services to Amazon SageMaker and Amazon Bedrock. The main content revolved around foundation models (Claude, Llama, Titan), prompt engineering techniques (zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought), and RAG architectures for building Q&A systems on internal enterprise data. Through this session, I gained a clearer understanding of the differences between traditional ML and GenAI, the role of SageMaker in standardizing end-to-end pipelines, and how to combine Bedrock + embeddings + RAG to reduce hallucinations and fully leverage internal data. This is a direct foundation for my ongoing ideas to build specialized chatbots (e.g., legal chatbots, document analysis).

### [Event 4](4.4-Event4/)

 **Event Name:** DevOps on AWS

 **Date & Time:** 8:30 – 17:00, 17/11/2025

 **Location:** 26th Floor, Bitexco Tower, 02 Hai Trieu Street, Saigon Ward, Ho Chi Minh City

 **Role:** Attendee

 **Event Summary:** The DevOps on AWS event moved from the DevOps mindset to the tooling ecosystem and operational architecture on AWS: CodeCommit, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, CodePipeline for CI/CD; CloudFormation and CDK for Infrastructure as Code; ECR, ECS, EKS, App Runner for containers; and CloudWatch, X-Ray for monitoring & observability. The content was presented as a logical chain: from automated build–test–deploy processes, infrastructure defined as code, to how microservices are deployed and monitored in real-world environments. Through this session, I learned to view DevOps as a holistic mindset (culture + process + tooling), understood clearly the benefits of IaC over ClickOps, grasped container options for different levels of complexity, and recognized that observability is mandatory once systems start to scale. This knowledge helps me define more clearly how to design CI/CD pipelines and deployment environments for my AI/ML and web application projects.

### [Event 5](4.5-Event5/)

 **Event Name:** AWS Well-Architected Security Pillar

 **Date & Time:** 08:30 – 12:00, 29/11/2025

 **Location:** 26th Floor, Bitexco Tower, 02 Hai Trieu Street, Saigon Ward, Ho Chi Minh City

 **Role:** Attendee

**Event Summary:** The event focused entirely on the Security Pillar in the AWS Well-Architected Framework with its 5 components: Identity & Access Management, Detection, Infrastructure Protection, Data Protection, and Incident Response. The content spanned from modern IAM architecture (multi-account, SSO, SCPs, permission boundaries, MFA, Access Analyzer) to detection-as-code with CloudTrail, GuardDuty, Security Hub; infrastructure security with VPC segmentation, Security Groups, NACLs, Network Firewall; encryption and key/secret management with KMS and Secrets Manager; and finally IR playbooks for situations such as compromised IAM keys, S3 public exposure, and EC2 malware. From this session, I better understood that security must be designed at the architectural level rather than being a “patch” at the end, learned how to build a minimal IAM and logging/detection foundation for every workload, and gained a more concrete view of preparing playbooks and automation for incident response. This is an important basis for designing AI/ML systems and applications on AWS that are secure, compliant, and resilient in the face of incidents.
