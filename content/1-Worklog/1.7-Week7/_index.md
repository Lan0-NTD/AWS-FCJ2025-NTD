### Week 7 Objectives:

*   Learn about the architecture and basic concepts of Kubernetes.
*   Learn how to deploy and manage applications on Amazon EKS.
*   Build a complete CI/CD pipeline to automate deployment to EKS.

### Tasks accomplished this week:
| Day | Task | Start Date | Completion Date | Reference Material |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2 | Refine the architecture details.<br>Read lab 126:<br>- How to initialize a cluster, worker nodes & management architecture. <br>- Understand basic concepts: Pod, Deployment, DaemonSet, … — how Kubernetes organizes containers. <br>- How to deploy micro-services on EKS. | 20/10/2025 | 21/10/2025 | <https://000126.awsstudygroup.com/vi/> |
| 4 | Project team meeting:<br>- Agree on data sources and data formats.<br>- Test features, fix bugs.<br>- Define user flow. | 22/10/2025 | 22/10/2025 | |
| 5 | Complete lab 62:<br>- Set up Amazon EKS — initialize a Kubernetes cluster.<br>- Use AWS CodePipeline + AWS CodeBuild + GitHub to create a CI/CD pipeline: whenever there is a new commit, the pipeline automatically builds the container, pushes the image, and deploys to EKS.<br>- Configure RBAC to grant CodeBuild/CodePipeline permissions to deploy to the cluster. | 23/10/2025 | 23/10/2025 | <https://000062.awsstudygroup.com/vi/> |
| 6 | Weekly team progress report meeting. | 24/10/2025 | 24/10/2025 | |
