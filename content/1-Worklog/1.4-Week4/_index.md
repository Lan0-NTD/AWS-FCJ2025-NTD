### Week 4 Achievements:

* Understood the purpose, architecture, and use cases of **AWS VM Import/Export** for seamless migration of virtual machines from on-premises or other environments to AWS.

* Learned the workflow and role of:

  * **AWS Database Migration Service (DMS)** in migrating data between different database engines while minimizing downtime.
  * **AWS Schema Conversion Tool (SCT)** in converting schemas during heterogeneous database migrations.

* Became familiar with **AWS Lambda** and the serverless execution model, including:

  * Implementing automatic start/stop logic for EC2 servers using Lambda.
  * Exploring Slack integration to send notifications during automated tasks.

* Learned how to **create monitoring dashboards** using:

  * **Amazon CloudWatch** for metrics collection, logging, and alarm creation.
  * **Grafana** for visualizing monitoring data from CloudWatch in a clear and intuitive manner.

* Gained understanding of how to **manage resources using Tag and Resource Groups**, including:

  * Applying structured tags to resources for easier filtering, management, and cost allocation.
  * Creating and using **Resource Groups** to work with sets of resources that share common attributes.

* Understood how to **manage access to EC2 services using IAM with tag-based conditions**, enabling:

  * Building IAM policies based on Tags (tag-based access control).
  * Restricting or granting permissions more granularly to specific resource groups.

* Became familiar with **AWS Systems Manager** and its role in:

  * Managing configuration and operational state of resources.
  * Automating operational tasks across EC2 instances and hybrid environments.
