### Week 3 Achievements:

* Gained understanding of the concepts, roles, and main use cases of **Amazon RDS**, including its advantages compared to managing a self-hosted database on EC2.

* Understood how to **optimize compute costs with Amazon Lightsail**, including its fixed-price plans and how it differs from EC2 in simpler deployment scenarios.

* Learned the basic operational mechanism of **Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling**, including:

  * The concept of an Auto Scaling Group.
  * How EC2 instances automatically scale in or out based on system load.

* Learned how to **create system monitoring dashboards using Amazon CloudWatch**, including configuring metrics, monitoring charts, and tracking EC2 instance health.

* Completed hands-on exercises:

  * Created a **database on Amazon RDS** and configured essential parameters.
  * Created an **EC2 instance in an Auto Scaling Group** with automatic scaling policies.
  * Configured **Amazon CloudWatch** to monitor the newly created EC2 instance, supporting performance tracking and operational visibility.
