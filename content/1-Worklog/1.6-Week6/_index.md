### Week 6 Achievements:

* Understood the **Serverless model on AWS** through hands-on labs with Lambda interacting with **S3** and **DynamoDB**, including:

  * How Lambda reads/writes data from S3.
  * How Lambda performs basic operations on DynamoDB.

* Understood the role of **Amazon API Gateway** in a serverless architecture:

  * The request flow from client → API Gateway → Lambda.
  * How to configure endpoints to forward requests to Lambda functions.

* Explored an overview of **Amazon Cognito**:

  * Understood User Pools and Identity Pools.
  * Learned the purpose of Cognito in user authentication and user management for web/mobile applications.

* Became familiar with deploying applications using the **AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM)**:

  * Understood the meaning of the template file (Infrastructure as Code – IaC).
  * Learned the workflow of building, deploying, and updating serverless applications via SAM.

* Completed the **end-to-end application deployment exercise**, including:

  * Deploying the **Frontend** that connects to the serverless backend.
  * Deploying **Lambda Functions** to handle backend logic.
  * Configuring **API Gateway** to connect the frontend with Lambda.
  * Testing API functionality through **Postman** and validating results from the frontend interface.

* Coordinated with team members to:

  * Finalize preliminary project ideas using a serverless architecture.
  * Identify and deploy essential AWS services and strengthen related knowledge for the next development phase.
